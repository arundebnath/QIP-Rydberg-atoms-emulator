# Quantum-Computing algorithms based on Rydberg atom based emulators

Here, I provide a set of elementary codes that provide basic introduction to Rydberg atom based quantum computational platform. 

$$
\frac{\mathcal{H}(t)}{\hbar} = \sum_j \frac{\Omega_j(t)}{2} \left( e^{i \phi_j(t) } | g_j \rangle  \langle r_j | + e^{-i \phi_j(t) } | r_j \rangle  \langle g_j | \right) - \sum_j \Delta_j(t) \hat{n}_j + \sum_{j < k} V_{jk} \hat{n}_j \hat{n}_k,
$$
